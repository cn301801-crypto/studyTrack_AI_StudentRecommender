#OBGECTIVE:
-Understanding the dataset:Exploring the student information, activity logs and learning pattern.Identify key features that influence student recommendation.
-Clean and preprocess:Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries. Transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
-Merge multiple data sources:Combine student profiles, course activities, and performance metrics into a unified dataset.
-Perform Exploratory data analysis:Visualize trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. Identify insights that will guide the recommendation system.
Prepare dataset for AI modeling:Generate features and ensure the dataset is ready for building predictive or recommendation models.

#DATASET SOURCE:
-Downlode the dataset from the kaggle
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance
-It contain two csv file student_mat.csv and student_por.csv

#STEPS FOLLOWED
-join:used to merge 
-clean:handling the missing and duplicate values
-visualize:create plots and charts to understand trends and patterns

#TOOLS USED
-python 3.10.6
-Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn
-Pycharm IDE

#KEY INSIGHTS
-Student engagement patterns
-Performance trends
-Cource Completion behaviour
-Feature Correlation
-Data Quality Insights

#GRAPH PLACEHOLDERS
-Histogram:Shows how student scores are distributed across the dataset.
-Scatter plot:Shows the relation between time spent on the platform and overall score.
-Bar chart:Compare average performance across subject.
-Heapamp:Shows correlations between numeric feature (hour spent,quiz score,assignment score,total score).
